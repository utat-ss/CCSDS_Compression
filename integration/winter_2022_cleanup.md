# Getting CCSDS in C to work

## image format
- assume the `datacube` struct has its image data pre-organized into a band sequential order (BSQ)
- BSQ is the most intuitive ordering for hyperspectral data
    - all the data for 1 wavelength is on the first frame
    - all the data for the next wavelength is on the second frame, etc
- will need to write some memory parser
    - DCMI streamed data will not be like this
    - raw DCMI data frames are streamed and stacked sequentially in memory, forming a data cube
    - but we have to "view" the datacube from the side face to recover the BSQ representation
    - this is because of the push-broom scanning nature of the image
        - need multiple time indices to view the actual topological image
        - 1 frame is just wavelengths split from 1 slit


## datacube structure
- it's many stacks of `mymatrix` structs
    - aka data cube is many matrices stacked on each other
- `mymatrix` structs are assumed to be row-major format
    - indexing for a 2-row by 4-column matrix in row-major format goes like
> 0   1   2   3\
> 4   5   6   7

- note that this is different from column-major format
    - most C/C++ computational libraries use a column-major format because it can lead to speedups
    - indexing for a 2-row by 4-column matrix column-major goes like
> 0   2   4   6 \
> 1   3   5   7

## Viewing hex files
- us VSCode hex editor
- or `hexdump -C <binary_file>`
    - `-C` = canonical, always get consistent byte-by-byte output regardless of your system's endianness

## writing to bitfile
Yong Da Li, Saturday, July 16, 2022
- note that the bitfile library BitFilePutBits() (plural) gives some weird padding issue
  - breaks assumptions about binary file structure
  - falling back to use the singular BitFilePutBit() and looping through --> avoids padding issue

- remove dependence on GSL library

### restructure
- changed to have a top-level make file

### predictor
- reread that paper to re-familiarize myself with the predictor
>Post-print of: "A tutorial on image compression for optical space imaging systems" / I. Blanes, E. Magli, J. Serra-SagristÃ  in IEEE Geoscience and remote sensing magazine (IEEE), Vol. 2, Issue 3 (Sept. 2014) , p. 8-26. DOI 10.1109/MGRS.2014.2352465

### away from GSL
- since we're literally only doing vector-vector operations, I made my own matrix/vector library
- don't need to use GSL
- this is work that needs to be done at some point --> need to make it work on ARM math operations

### VSCode
- back to using VSCode on Windows side (not SSH into WLS2)
    - file index doesn't refresh automatically --> annoying because file list is not accurate

### decompression
- run the predictor to see what the predicted values are
- take the residuals and add it
- recover the real value
- reference App.java (line 176: decoder.decode) > Decoder.java (line 267: predictor.decompress) > Predictor.java (line 467)

### game plan
- going to make all changes on the `integration` branch then nuke it back to main
- I think I should have (based on structure of other C code):
    - encoder / decoder
    - predictor / unpredictor
    - helper / utils
    - main / compressor

### makefiles
- modernized the makefile for encoder to take a list of source files and automatically generate dependencies, to produce an executable
  
### VSCode
- hex editor in VSCode makes viewing binary files much easier
- run VSCode from WSL Ubuntu SSH connection because I configured the C/C++ intelisense to find `/usr/include/gsl/*` for the `gsl` header files
